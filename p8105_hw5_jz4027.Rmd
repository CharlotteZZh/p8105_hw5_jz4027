  )
```

```{r}
# A plot showing the probability of repeated birthday for each group size
bday_sim_results |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = bdays, y = prob_repeat)) +

  labs(
    title = "Birthday Simulation",
    x = "Number of People in the Room",
    y = "Probability of Shared Birthday"
  ) + 
  theme_minimal()
```
The plot shows that as the number of people in the room increases, the probability of shared birthday also increases. The probability of shared birthday approaches 1 as the number of people approaching 50. Around 23 people, the probability is approximately 0.5, meaning that there is a 50% chance that two people share the same birthday.
