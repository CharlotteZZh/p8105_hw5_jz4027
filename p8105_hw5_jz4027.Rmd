# Problem 1
```{r}
# Write the function
bday_sim = function(n_room) {
  birthdays = sample(1:365, n_room, replace = TRUE)
  repeated_bday = length(unique(birthdays)) < n_room
  repeated_bday
}

bday_sim(20)
```

```{r}
# Run the simulation 10000 times for each group size from 2 to 50
bday_sim_results = 
  expand_grid(
    bdays = 2:50, 
    iter = 1:10000
  ) |> 
  mutate(
    result = map_lgl(bdays, bday_sim)
  ) |> 
  group_by(
    bdays
  ) |> 
  summarize(
    prob_repeat = mean(result)
  )
```

```{r}
# A plot showing the probability of repeated birthday for each group size
bday_sim_results |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = bdays, y = prob_repeat)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_line() + 
  labs(
    title = "Birthday Simulation",
    x = "Number of People in the Room",
    y = "Probability of Shared Birthday"
  ) + 
  theme_minimal()
```
The plot shows that as the number of people in the room increases, the probability of shared birthday also increases. The probability of shared birthday approaches 1 as the number of people approaching 50. Around 23 people, the probability is approximately 0.5, meaning that there is a 50% chance that two people share the same birthday.

    data = map(mu, ~ rnorm(30, mean = .x, sd = 5)),
    test = map(data, ~ t.test(.x, mu = 0)),
    tidy = map(test, tidy)

  select(mu, estimate, p.value)
